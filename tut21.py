# 1.Arithmetic operators

# print("5 + 6 is =", 5+6)
# print("5 - 6 is =", 5-6)
# print("5 * 6 is =", 5*6)
# print("5 / 6 is =", 5/6)
# print("5 ** 3 is =", 5**3)
# print("5 % 2 is =", 5%2)
# print("5 // 6 is =", 15//6)

# 2.Assignment operators
x = 5
# print(x)
x += 7    # x-=7 x*=7 x/=7 x%=7
# print(x)


# 3.Comparison operators

# i = 5
# print(i == 5)
# print(i <= 5)
# print(i >= 5)
# print(i < 5)
# print(i > 5)
# print(i != 5)

# 4.logical operators

a = True
b = False
# print(a and b)
# print(a or b)
# print(a && b) - wrong
# print(a || b) -  wrong

# 5.Identity operators
a = True
b = False
# print(a is b)
# print(a is not b)

# 6.Membership operators

list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# print(1 in list)
# print(2 not in list)

# 7.Bitwise operators
# 0-00
# 1-01
# 2-10
# 3-11

print(0 & 1)
print(0 | 2)
